	abstract = {Quantum computers promise to efficiently solve important problems that are intractable on a conventional computer. For quantum systems, where the dimension of the problem space grows exponentially, finding the eigenvalues of certain operators is one such intractable problem and remains a fundamental challenge. The quantum phase estimation algorithm can efficiently find the eigenvalue of a given eigenvector but requires fully coherent evolution. We present an alternative approach that greatly reduces the requirements for coherent evolution and we combine this method with a new approach to state preparation based on ans{\textbackslash}"atze and classical optimization. We have implemented the algorithm by combining a small-scale photonic quantum processor with a conventional computer. We experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of this approach with an example from quantum chemistry: calculating the ground state molecular energy for He-H+, to within chemical accuracy. The proposed approach, by drastically reducing the coherence time requirements, enhances the potential of the quantum resources available today and in the near future.},

	abstract = {The variational quantum eigensolver (or VQE) uses the variational principle to compute the ground state energy of a Hamiltonian, a problem that is central to quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics. Conventional computing methods are constrained in their accuracy due to the computational limits. The VQE may be used to model complex wavefunctions in polynomial time, making it one of the most promising near-term applications for quantum computing. Finding a path to navigate the relevant literature has rapidly become an overwhelming task, with many methods promising to improve different parts of the algorithm. Despite strong theoretical underpinnings suggesting excellent scaling of individual VQE components, studies have pointed out that their various pre-factors could be too large to reach a quantum computing advantage over conventional methods. This review aims to provide an overview of the progress that has been made on the different parts of the algorithm. All the different components of the algorithm are reviewed in detail including representation of Hamiltonians and wavefunctions on a quantum computer, the optimization process, the post-processing mitigation of errors, and best practices are suggested. We identify four main areas of future research:(1) optimal measurement schemes for reduction of circuit repetitions; (2) large scale parallelization across many quantum computers;(3) ways to overcome the potential appearance of vanishing gradients in the optimization process, and how the number of iterations required for the optimization scales with system size; (4) the extent to which VQE suffers for quantum noise, and whether this noise can be mitigated. The answers to these open research questions will determine the routes for the VQE to achieve quantum advantage as the quantum computing hardware scales up and as the noise levels are reduced.},

This problem was formatted as a single, constrained quadratic optimization in 1964 by Mangasarian and Stone. Here, we show that adding penalty terms to the quadratic function formulation of Nash equilibrium gives a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulation of this problem that can be executed on quantum annealers. Three examples are discussed to highlight the success of the formulation, and an overall, time-to-solution (hardware + software processing) speed up of seven to ten times is reported on quantum annealers developed by D-Wave System.},

Owing to the importance of spin glasses as a paradigmatic computational testbed, reproducing this phenomenon in a programmable system has remained a central challenge in quantum optimization4–13. Here we achieve this goal by realizing quantum-critical spin-glass dynamics on thousands of qubits with a superconducting quantum annealer. We first demonstrate quantitative agreement between quantum annealing and time evolution of the Schrödinger equation in small spin glasses. We then measure dynamics in three-dimensional spin glasses on thousands of qubits, for which classical simulation of many-body quantum dynamics is intractable. We extract critical exponents that clearly distinguish quantum annealing from the slower stochastic dynamics of analogous Monte Carlo algorithms, providing both theoretical and experimental support for large-scale quantum simulation and a scaling advantage in energy optimization.},

To address this discrepancy, a quantum-classical hybrid optimization scheme known as ‘the quantum variational eigensolver’ was developed (Peruzzo et al 2014 Nat. Commun. 5 4213) with the philosophy that even minimal quantum resources could be made useful when used in conjunction with classical routines. In this work we extend the general theory of this algorithm and suggest algorithmic improvements for practical implementations. Specifically, we develop a variational adiabatic ansatz and explore unitary coupled cluster where we establish a connection from second order unitary coupled cluster to universal gate sets through a relaxation of exponential operator splitting. We introduce the concept of quantum variational error suppression that allows some errors to be suppressed naturally in this algorithm on a pre-threshold quantum device. Additionally, we analyze truncation and correlated sampling in Hamiltonian averaging as ways to reduce the cost of this procedure. Finally, we show how the use of modern derivative free optimization techniques can offer dramatic computational savings of up to three orders of magnitude over previously used optimization techniques.},

To ensure that the system evolves to the desired final ground state, the evolution time must be big enough. The time required depends on the minimum energy difference between the two lowest states of the interpolating Hamiltonian. We are unable to estimate this gap in general.

We develop a quantum algorithm that computes the gradient of a multi-variate real-valued function \$f:{\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}d{\textbackslash}rightarrow {\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}\$ by evaluating it at only a logarithmic number of points in superposition. Our algorithm is an improved version of Stephen Jordan's gradient computation algorithm, providing an approximation of the gradient \${\textbackslash}nabla f\$ with quadratically better dependence on the evaluation accuracy of \$f\$, for an important class of smooth functions. Furthermore, we show that most objective functions arising from quantum optimization procedures satisfy the necessary smoothness conditions, hence our algorithm provides a quadratic improvement in the complexity of computing their gradient. We also show that in a continuous phase-query model, our gradient computation algorithm has optimal query complexity up to poly-logarithmic factors, for a particular class of smooth functions. Moreover, we show that for low-degree multivariate polynomials our algorithm can provide exponential speedups compared to Jordan's algorithm in terms of the dimension \$d\$. One of the technical challenges in applying our gradient computation procedure for quantum optimization problems is the need to convert between a probability oracle (which is common in quantum optimization procedures) and a phase oracle (which is common in quantum algorithms) of the objective function \$f\$. We provide efficient subroutines to perform this delicate interconversion between the two types of oracles incurring only a logarithmic overhead, which might be of independent interest. Finally, using these tools we improve the runtime of prior approaches for training quantum auto-encoders, variational quantum eigensolvers (VQE), and quantum approximate optimization algorithms (QAOA).},

We find that the full-entanglement CRX and TQR ansatzes can sufficiently describe the ground state energy of the long-range XY model. In contrast, only the full-entanglement TQR ansatz can represent the ground state wavefunction with a fidelity close to one. In addition, we find that instead of using full-entanglement ansatzes, restricted-entanglement ansatzes where entangling gates are applied only between qubits that are a fixed distance from each other already suffice to give acceptable solutions. Using the entanglement entropy to characterize the expressive powers of the VQE ansatzes, we show that the full-entanglement TQR ansatz has the highest expressive power among them.},

	abstract = {Solving linear systems of equations is a common problem that arises both on its own and as a subroutine in more complex problems: given a matrix A and a vector b, find a vector x such that Ax=b. We consider the case where one doesn't need to know the solution x itself, but rather an approximation of the expectation value of some operator associated with x, e.g., x'Mx for some matrix M. In this case, when A is sparse, N by N and has condition number kappa, classical algorithms can find x and estimate x'Mx in O(N sqrt(kappa)) time. Here, we exhibit a quantum algorithm for this task that runs in poly(log N, kappa) time, an exponential improvement over the best classical algorithm.},

	abstract = {We propose SnCQA, a set of hardware-efficient variational circuits of equivariant quantum convolutional circuits respective to permutation symmetries and spatial lattice symmetries with the number of qubits \$n\$. By exploiting permutation symmetries of the system, such as lattice Hamiltonians common to many quantum many-body and quantum chemistry problems, Our quantum neural networks are suitable for solving machine learning problems where permutation symmetries are present, which could lead to significant savings of computational costs. Aside from its theoretical novelty, we find our simulations perform well in practical instances of learning ground states in quantum computational chemistry, where we could achieve comparable performances to traditional methods with few tens of parameters. Compared to other traditional variational quantum circuits, such as the pure hardware-efficient ansatz (pHEA), we show that SnCQA is more scalable, accurate, and noise resilient (with \$20{\textbackslash}times\$ better performance on \$3 {\textbackslash}times 4\$ square lattice and \$200{\textbackslash}\% - 1000{\textbackslash}\%\$ resource savings in various lattice sizes and key criterions such as the number of layers, parameters, and times to converge in our cases), suggesting a potentially favorable experiment on near-time quantum devices.},

	abstract = {The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), a variational algorithm to obtain an approximated ground state of a given Hamiltonian, is an appealing application of near-term quantum computers. The original work [A. Peruzzo et al.; {\textbackslash}textit\{Nat. Commun.\}; {\textbackslash}textbf\{5\}, 4213 (2014)] focused only on finding a ground state, whereas the excited states can also induce interesting phenomena in molecules and materials. Calculating excited states is, in general, a more difficult task than finding ground states for classical computers. To extend the framework to excited states, we here propose an algorithm, the subspace-search variational quantum eigensolver (SSVQE). This algorithm searches a low energy subspace by supplying orthogonal input states to the variational ansatz and relies on the unitarity of transformations to ensure the orthogonality of output states. The \$k\$-th excited state is obtained as the highest energy state in the low energy subspace. The proposed algorithm consists only of two parameter optimization procedures and does not employ any ancilla qubits. The disuse of the ancilla qubits is a great improvement from the existing proposals for excited states, which have utilized the swap test, making our proposal a truly near-term quantum algorithm. We further generalize the SSVQE to obtain all excited states up to the \$k\$-th by only a single optimization procedure. From numerical simulations, we verify the proposed algorithms. This work greatly extends the applicable domain of the VQE to excited states and their related properties like a transition amplitude without sacrificing any feasibility of it.},
